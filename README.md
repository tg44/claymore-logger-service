# claymore-logger-service

It's a simple poll and send service for the famous [claymore](https://github.com/nanopool/Claymore-Dual-Miner) eth miner.

The service is parsing the information from the given rigs/endpoints, and POST it to a given webservice.

Stay tuned for the backend, and user friendly pack and run options!

(Your rigs need to be run on windows, because only the claymore-windows has the needed tcp endpoint :( )
